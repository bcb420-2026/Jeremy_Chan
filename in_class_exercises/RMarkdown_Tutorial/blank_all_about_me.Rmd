## Bio {#bachelors-degree}

Hello, my name is Jeremy! I am an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, and I am in my 4th year. I am specialising in [Bioinformatics & Computational Biology](https://bcb.csb.utoronto.ca/), along with minors in [Computer Science](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/) and [Linguistics](https://www.linguistics.utoronto.ca/). Currently, I'm undergoing my thesis project studying cancer cell lineages at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre under the supervision of Dr. Federico Gaiti.

## Bachelors Degree

###  {#bachelors-degree-table}

**Table 1. Record of all undergraduate courses**

```{r courses_table, include=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
paged_table(courses)
```

###  {#bachelors-degree-figure}

```{r courses_figure, include=TRUE,echo=TRUE, fig.cap = "**Figure 1: Summary of undergraduate courses.** Barplot of the number of courses taken through my undergraduate degree. Colours represent the category of each courseas part of the undergraduate course requirements."}
## organize the data for plotting
courses_plot <- courses %>%
  count(Course_Department, course_type) 

# generate plot 
ggplot(courses_plot, aes(fill = course_type, x=Course_Department, y=n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(0, 10),
    breaks = seq(0, 10, by = 1)
  ) +
  labs(title = "Jeremy's undergraduate degree", x = "Course Department", y = "Number of courses") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1))
```

## Hobbies

###  {#my-hobbies}

I have a few hobbies that I like to do when I have some free time, but most of my time is spent relaxing!

### {#hobbies-hours-per-week}
### {#favorite-hobby}
```{r hobby_figure, include=TRUE,echo=TRUE, fig.cap = "**Figure 2: Time spent on my hobbies.** Barplot of the hours that I spent weekly on each of my hobbies."}
ggplot(hobbies, aes(x=hobby, y=hours_per_week)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Jeremy's weekly hobbies", x = "Hobby", y = "Hours spent per week")
```

## Travelling! {#custom-section}

One of the things I love to do is travel! In 2025, I visited 12 different countries. Here is a collage of pictures of some of the places I went:
